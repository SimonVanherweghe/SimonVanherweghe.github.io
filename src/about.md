---

Simon Vanherweghe is a lecturer who specializes in teaching web development and creative code. When he's not in the classroom, he loves to explore all kinds of different projects, whether they involve coding, crafting, or something in between. When he's not working on his latest project, you can often find him out with his family. Besides that, he loves cycling, enjoying the outdoors and exploring new routes.

In the kitchen he likes to try out new recipes and dive deep into specific dishes. Ramen, sourdough, pizza, bbq are just a few of his favorite things to make. He also loves to experiment with different ingredients and techniques.

## Site

Traditionally for a developer, this site is a victim of continuous overhauls, experiments and bugs.

It is build with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), initially based on [Eleventy duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) and sprinkled with some [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) flavours for the styling. If you want to have a look at the code, you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/SimonVanherweghe/SimonVanherweghe.github.io)
